## Analyses
The analyses - performed in R - seek to identify the factors that correlate most to employee satisfaction. For instance, the Spearman Correlation matrices (Fig. 1 and 2) showed several very strong correlations between work perceptions.

An unpaired two-sample t-test indicated that there is a statistically significant difference in the likelihood to quit between the full-time and part-time groups. Subsequently, a Tukey test was performed to compute multiple pairwise comparisons on groups with varying tenures.

## Advice to Management
Employees feel that Macaroni’s is the best organization to work for when they receive adequate training and their team members cooperate well together. However, results also indicated that full-time employees think about quitting much more frequently than part-time employees.

Management needs to focus on establishing positive-thinking supervisors and a teamwork setting. Employee feelings about supervisor recognition and group cooperation matter more than attitudes towards competitive pay.
